    document: "Chest X-ray: There is focal airspace opacity in the right lower lobe with air bronchograms. No pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits."
    summary: "Right lower lobe consolidation without effusion; findings suggest pneumonia."
  - id: 2
    document: "CT head without contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. Mild periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes."
    summary: "No acute intracranial abnormality; chronic microvascular changes present."
