# MedAISure Specialty Dataset

Short description: Specialty-focused tasks across subdomains (e.g., cardiology, neurology, oncology, radiology, rheumatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology). Useful for targeted model evaluation and fine-grained analysis.

- ID: `medaisure-specialty`
- Size: 80
- Composition: `{ diagnostics: 40, summarization: 20, communication: 20 }`
- Categories: diagnostics, summarization, communication

## Registry & Validation

```python
from bench.data.datasets import medaisure_specialty as spec

spec.validate()  # raises on composition/category inconsistencies
print(spec.get_composition())
print(spec.list_categories())
```

## Example Listing Rows (placeholders)

These rows mimic the structure returned by the CLI task listing and are generated by the stub helper:

```python
from bench.data.datasets import medaisure_specialty as spec
rows = spec.example_listing_rows(limit=6)
for r in rows:
    print(r)
```

## CLI

- List datasets (with composition):

```bash
python -m bench.cli_typer list-datasets --with-composition
```

- Show this dataset:

```bash
python -m bench.cli_typer show-dataset medaisure-specialty
```
