# MedAISure Hard Dataset

Short description: A curated collection of challenging/adversarial or edge cases that stress safety-critical diagnostic reasoning and robust summarization/communication.

- ID: `medaisure-hard`
- Size: 60
- Composition: `{ diagnostics: 40, summarization: 10, communication: 10 }`
- Categories: diagnostics, summarization, communication

## Registry & Validation

```python
from bench.data.datasets import medaisure_hard as hard

hard.validate()  # raises on composition/category inconsistencies
print(hard.get_composition())
print(hard.list_categories())
```

## Example Listing Rows (placeholders)

These rows mimic the structure returned by the CLI task listing and are generated by the stub helper:

```python
from bench.data.datasets import medaisure_hard as hard
rows = hard.example_listing_rows(limit=6)
for r in rows:
    print(r)
```

## CLI

- List datasets (with composition):

```bash
python -m bench.cli_typer list-datasets --with-composition
```

- Show this dataset:

```bash
python -m bench.cli_typer show-dataset medaisure-hard
```
